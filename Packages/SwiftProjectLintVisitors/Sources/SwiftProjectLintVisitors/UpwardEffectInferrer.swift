/// described as one hop. So:
/// - `depth: 1` means the function's lub-contributing callees are all
///   declared or heuristic anchors (the single-pass / one-hop case).
/// - `depth: 2+` means at least one lub-contributing callee was itself
///   upward-inferred (multi-hop fixed-point).

/// Phase-2.3 body-based effect inference ("upward inference").
///
/// Given an un-annotated function declaration, walks its body and computes
/// an inferred effect as the lattice lub of the effects of its direct
/// callees. If the body contains a non-idempotent call, the function itself
/// is inferred non-idempotent; if all calls are observational, the function
/// is observational; and so on.
///
/// ## Precedence in rule lookups
///
/// Rules consult effects in this order:
///
///   declared  >  collision-withdraw (silent)  >  upward-inferred  >  heuristic-downward  >  silent
///
/// Upward beats heuristic-downward because body analysis is a stronger
/// signal than name matching. A function named `insert` whose body only
/// calls `logMetric` is observational (upward) rather than non-idempotent
/// (downward-name).
///
/// ## Single-pass vs multi-hop
///
/// `inferEffects` itself is single-pass and order-invariant: the resolver
/// closure decides what to return for each callee, and the inferrer just
/// takes the lub. The "one-hop" or "multi-hop" policy lives in the
/// resolver — see `EffectSymbolTable.applyUpwardInference(multiHop:)`.
/// In one-hop mode the resolver returns only declared and heuristic-
/// downward effects. In multi-hop mode it also returns prior-pass upward
/// results, and `EffectSymbolTable` iterates `inferEffects` to a fixed
/// point.
///
/// ## Escaping-closure policy
///
/// Same as the rule visitors: body analysis stops at `Task { }`,
/// `withTaskGroup`, `Task.detached`, SwiftUI `.task { }`. Calls inside
/// those boundaries are in a different retry context and do not propagate
/// their effects to the enclosing function.
